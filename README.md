# The weather app challenge "GDBflutter" : 

It is a mobile application using Flutter where you can add specific cities to see their weather conditions such as temperature, humidity ... 
from an API.

The project is incomplete ðŸ™‚ Edits that I will make in the future :

- Optimize the code and split it in an organized way.
- The application currently fetch from the API only the name of the city in question, so other information such as temperature must be fetched.
- Icons and images will change according to the city's atmosphere.
- Add design improvements(Inkwell , space between city's name and temperature ..). 
- Store previously searched cities and add refresh option.
